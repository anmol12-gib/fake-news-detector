# 📰 Fake News Detection Tool

Ever read a headline and thought, *“Wait… is this for real?”*  
This project is here to help you find out in seconds.  

It’s a **React + Flask** app powered by a **pretrained AI model** (via Hugging Face Transformers) that tells you whether a news headline is **Fake** or **Real** — along with a confidence score and even a quick AI-generated summary.
